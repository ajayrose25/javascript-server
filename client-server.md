# How a Request gets Served

* Many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer).

* Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. 

* Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them.

* Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines. 

* In hospital data processing, for example, a client computer can be running an application program for entering patient information while the server computer is running another program that manages the database in which the information is permanently stored.

* To communicate, the client the server must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. The language and rules of communication are defined in a communications protocol. All client-server protocols operate in the application layer. 

* A server may receive requests from many distinct clients in a short period of time. A computer can only perform a limited number of tasks at any moment, and relies on a scheduling system to prioritize incoming requests from clients to accommodate them.
